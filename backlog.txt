- get voxel hovering working (print to console)
- shader to highlight a hovered voxel
- allow disabling smoothing voxel (click-to-toggle)
- allow removing original voxel (click to toggle)
- auto-save mvSmooth file

- have pattern be defined once and then rotate-checked
- fix up and add to patterns

- get simpler native file interface for user (you should only need to specify vox file and others are auto-handled based on vox)

- optimize exported OBJ file
	- don't export faces that are covered (backsides of voxels)

- polish ui (menus)
- export normals
